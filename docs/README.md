## 1.Problem Overview
Deficiencies of Manual Attendance Management System​
+ Time-Consuming Process​
+ Prone to Errors​
+ Lack of Real-Time Data​
+ Bureaucratic Hassles​
+ Limited Scalability​
+ Security Concerns​
 
## 2.Why is this need?
+ Efficiency in Tracking With Face Detection​
+ Multi Security Levels​
+ Error Reduction​
+ Real-Time Updates​
+ Streamlined Administration​
+ Scalability​
+ Enhanced Security
  
## 3.Solution Architecture
+ ###  High-Level Overview
  
  Out attendance management System has 3 tiers
+ Attendance Management Device
+ Backend Server
+ Frontend Dashboards (User & Admin)
  
+ ### Roles of the System


### 1.Admin
Admin can add and remove employees
See the employee details (image, name, absent date)
Unauthorized person entering alert (optional)

Attendance marks either face detection or fingerprint
They have their profile to see their attendance


   ### 3. Manager
Manages teams or departments.
Monitors employee attendance and performance.
May receive real-time notifications about attendance events.
